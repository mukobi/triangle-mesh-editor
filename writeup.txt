splitEdge()

2. LinearSubdivision and 3. CatmullClarkSubdivision
subdivideQuad()
computeLinearSubdivisionPositions()
computeCatmullClarkPositions()
assignSubdivisionIndices()
buildSubdivisionVertexList()
buildSubdivisionFaceList()

4. LoopSubdivision
upsample()

5. Create one beautiful 3D model using Cardinal3D

Comments and considerations:
Cool assignment, but a lot of the bugfixing wasn't 
anything too interesting, mostly just typos in local 
edge operations. It might be cool if one or both of 
`edgeFlip` and `edgeSplit` were already implemented 
so we didn't have to deal with as much of that pain,
but then you could require more of the extra stuff
be completed so overall each student implements more
of the functions.
